# 257. Binary Tree Paths

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

**Tree Structure:**
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
   \
    5
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
