# 🔄 Reverse String – In-Place Array Modification

## 📝 Problem Statement

Write a function that **reverses a string**.

You must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with **O(1)** extra memory.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Reverse the input character array `s` **in-place**.
- You must use **O(1) extra memory**.
- Do **not return** anything — just modify the array.

## 💡 Example 1

**Input:**  
`s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]`

**Output:**  
`s = ["o","l","l","e","h"]`

---

## 💡 Example 2

**Input:**  
`s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]`

**Output:**  
`s = ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]`

---

## ✅ Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is a **printable ASCII character**.
